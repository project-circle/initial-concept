# A document to store initial discussions

## UI (a bit early, but important)

- status updates / messages are broadcast to distinct groups of people
- interacting with a status update joins you into the 'chat'

## Friends

- New conversations can only include friends
- People in the conversation dont have to be friends with each other, just the person who started it. 
- Can see messages of non-friends in same conversation
- Adding friends works with friend requests like FB (two party approval)
- Friends can be added directly by email address (enter email, sends friend request to that user)
- Users can opt in to appear in name searches
- User can opt in to appear in friend suggestions (but these will be based on something e.g. same party, same gym. Not just, steve knows this guy)
- Can sort friends into groups, friends can be in multiple groups
- Somehow encourage groups based on subject (dota 2) and groups based on closeness (family, close friends etc)
- Unfriend no longer see conversations started by them. But can still see messages from them in conversations started by someone else.
- If someone is blocked you cant see messages from them or receive friend requests from them
